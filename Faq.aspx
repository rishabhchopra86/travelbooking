      <h3>
        Can I book tickets for infants on HappyEasyGo?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, you can book travel for infants under two years of age on HappyEasyGo. Make sure they have valid proof–of–age documents when they’re checking in, and remember that infants must be accompanied by an adult at least 18 years old. You can book no more than one infant per adult (hey, you try dealing with luggage, tickets, airport queues and two screaming babies by yourself). To avail of infant fares, the infant must be under 24 months of age throughout the entire itinerary that you’re booking. This includes both outbound and return journeys. If the infant is 24 months or above on the return journey, you need to make a separate booking using a child fare.

      <h3>
        What’s an e–ticket?
      </h3>
      <p>
       An e–ticket (electronic ticket) is a paperless electronic document with a unique confirmation number that neatly replaces the hassles of a paper ticket. When you purchase an e–ticket, we email it to you after the booking is complete. Simply print it out and bring it with you – along with a valid photo ID – to the airline counter when checking in for your flight.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        What is the maximum number of seats I can book?
      </h3>
      <p>
        A maximum of 9 seats can be booked at one time. If you need to book for more than 9 travelers you will have to re–complete the booking process for the additional travelers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Can I book a multi–city trip?      </h3>
      <p>

Does HappyEasyGo offer any loyalty programmes?
No, but there are attractive offers running on the homepage. Stay sharp and you might grab a great deal.

      <h3>
        I’ve been getting zero flight results on the search page. What gives?
      </h3>
      <p>
       Clear your browser cache and try the search again. If you still don’t get any flight results, it may either be because we can’t find flights for that route or because there’s no availability of flights for your dates.
      </p>

    <div>
      <h3>
        HWhere do I enter my frequent flyer number while booking domestic flights?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We do not have an option of entering the frequent flier number at the time of booking domestic flights. However, we can certainly pass on your frequent flier number to the airline. Just call us as soon as you book your ticket and tell us your trip id and your frequent flier number.

    <div>
      <h3>
        I’ve selected 5 passengers (adult + children). Why are some airlines missing from the search results?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some airlines don’t allow us to book more than 4 passengers (adult + children) in one go, so try to search for fewer passengers.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        I entered my payment details and hit submit – and all I got was a blank screen! I got charged but don’t have an e–ticket. What now?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We’re really sorry for the inconvenience. Please don’t worry. We’ll call you within four hours and complete this booking offline. We suggest you do not try booking again as you may end up getting charged twice. <br> If you’re really impatient, call us at and we’ll help you fix this immediately.
Questions after you’ve booked

      <h3>
        How do I know my reservation was booked?

      <h3>
        Do I need to confirm my flight reservation before I fly?
      </h3>
      <p>
        No, you don’t. If you really want to, though, you can by writing to our Customer Support Team at cs@happyeasygo.com or by contacting the airline directly.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>
       How do I confirm my seat assignments?
      </h3>
      <p>
        HappyEasyGo doesn’t do pre–seating. Some airlines will confirm your seat assignments – their rules for doing so vary – so call your airline directly to check whether you get to choose your seat.
      </p>
    </div>

      <h3>
        How do I get my e–ticket details?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We’ll send your e–ticket details to the email address you gave us when you made your reservation.

    <div>
      <h3>
        How do I get a boarding pass for an e–ticket?
      </h3>
      <p>
        You need to show your e–ticket confirmation email and your e–ticket number at the check–in counter. The airline representative will issue your boarding pass at that time.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        Do I have to show my e–ticket confirmation email at the airline check–in counter?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yes, you do. Some airports don’t allow you inside without a printout of your e–ticket, so be sure to carry one with you. If you’ve forgotten your e–ticket printout but can get to a computer, use our handy HappyEasyGo Ticket service (www.HappyEasyGo.com/ticket) to print yourself a copy.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>
        What if my paper tickets are lost or stolen?
      </h3>
      <p>
       If this happens, email us immediately and we’ll help you process a lost ticket application. In most cases, the airline will require you to purchase replacement tickets at “today’s” fare, meaning that day’s current published fares. Our travel specialist will facilitate the sale of these tickets. <br>
If your original paper tickets aren’t used within a designated period of time (usually 3–4 months, depending on the airline), you’ll receive a credit for the purchase price of the replacement tickets, after deducting an application fee (which, again, varies by airline). Of course, these policies and fees are subject to change at any time – ask our travel specialist for the most recent information for your airline’s replacement ticket rules and policies. We’re bound by these rules, so we strongly suggest you keep your paper tickets safe to begin with.

          <h3>
              What is an amendment?
          </h3>
          <p>
              An amendment is a fancy word for a change in your travel plan. You can change the date or time (or both) of your travel; you cannot, however, change the sector(s) on which you’re already booked. For example, if you’re booked on a flight from Mumbai to New Delhi, you can’t change your destination to Goa.
              Please note that airline changes are not allowed in case of amendments. However, you can cancel your existing reservation and re-book a different airline of your choice online.

We’ll collect these charges from you when we make the changes to your travel plans. We’ll also collect the difference in fare, if any, applicable when the amendment is made.
